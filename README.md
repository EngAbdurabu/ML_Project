## Introduction

This web application is designed to predict the risk of stroke for patients based on various health-related features. It uses a machine learning model trained on healthcare data to provide predictions. The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and integrates a pre-trained machine learning pipeline for making predictions.

## Features

- Predicts the risk of stroke for patients.
- Provides an easy-to-use API for making predictions.
- Uses a machine learning model for accurate predictions.
- Supports input data with health-related features.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-prediction-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd healthcare-prediction-app
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```shell
python app.py
```

The application will start, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

The application provides a simple API endpoint for making predictions. You can send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with JSON data containing the health-related features, and the API will respond with a prediction result.

Example API Request:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"gender":"Male","age":55,"hypertension":1,"heart_disease":0,"ever_married":"Yes","Residence_type":"Urban","avg_glucose_level":123.45,"bmi":26.2,"work_type":"Private","smoking_status":"formerly smoked"}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```

Example API Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": "Stroke Risk"
}
```

## Dependencies
